      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Joe</strong> and I’m currently working toward a full-stack web development certificate. I’ve always enjoyed creating things from scratch, and front-end design is where I feel most in my element, but I have a <em>TON</em> to learn still. I have a background in professional driving,  design, tech, creative writing, and plenty of wrenches turned.
