        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is <strong>Joe</strong> and I’m currently working toward a
          full-stack web development certificate. I’ve always enjoyed creating
          things from scratch, and front-end design is where I feel most in my
          element, but I have a <em>TON</em> to learn still. I have a background
          in professional driving, design, tech, creative writing, and plenty of
          wrenches turned.

        <h2>Link I Recommend</h2>
        <p>
          One site I really like is
          <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a>. It’s a
          great place to experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real time
          without needing to set up anything locally.
