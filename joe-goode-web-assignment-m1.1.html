        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is <strong>Joe</strong> and I’m currently working toward a
          full-stack web development certificate. I’ve always enjoyed creating
          things from scratch, and front-end design is where I feel most in my
          element, but I have a <em>TON</em> to learn still. I have a background
          in professional driving, design, tech, creative writing, and plenty of
          wrenches turned.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m passionate about learning new skills and love building creative
          projects that push my abilities. When I’m not working with code, you
          might find me writing, creating content on TikTok, exercising, gaming,
          or tinkering with engines. I have a deep curiosity for how things work
          and a big appreciation for design that tells a story.

        <h2>Link I Recommend</h2>
        <p>
          <!-- Link opens in a new tab using target="_blank" -->
          One site I really like is
          <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a>. It’s a
          great place to experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real time
          without needing to set up anything locally.
