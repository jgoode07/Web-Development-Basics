# About Me – HTML Introduction Project

This is a basic personal webpage created for my Web Development Basics course. The goal of this project was to build a simple "About Me" page using only HTML, while demonstrating proper use of semantic and physical tags. It includes a short introduction, some personal interests, and a few of my favourite things.

## Features
- Semantic layout using `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`
- Meta tags for SEO and accessibility
- Two unordered lists to organize my travel dreams and favourite movies
- Use of `<strong>`, `<em>`, and `<cite>` for physical emphasis
- External link using `<a>` with `target="_blank"` to open in a new tab
- Footer with a copyright notice

## Getting Started
To view the page:
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- GitHub Desktop for version control

## Notes
I created a separate branch to style a version of this project just for fun and to brush up on my Git skills. That version isn't part of the official assignment, but it helped me get more comfortable with version control again.
